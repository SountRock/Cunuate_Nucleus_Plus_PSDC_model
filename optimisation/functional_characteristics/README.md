## About the characteristics

All variables starting with:

* **`freq_freq`** – dependence of projection neuron firing frequency (those sending axons to the thalamus) on stimulus frequency, raw frequency data.
* **`freq_sps`** – dependence of **Spikes per Cycle** of projection neurons on stimulus frequency, raw frequency data.
* **`mN`** – used to check responses to **pressure stimulus**, ratio of +NBQX responses of projection neurons to responses without PSDC blockade. For understanding, it is recommended to read the article: [Nature 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05470-x).
* **`masISI`** – control of the “relief” of spike responses to the pressure stimulus under PSDC blockade. Conceptually, it monitors the change in “gaps” on the rasters. In fact, it is more important than it seems and can strongly affect the results.
